# Let's Do
A web app that curates local activities to help you plan your day. 
The concept is simple. We're always wondering what to do when there's tons of things to do. Sure we can Google it but then we're wasting tons of times and searching through website after website trying to find something that will fit our needs. 

What if there was an app that had a database of a bunch of highly recommended activities to do and you could filter and sort through all those activities in order to find the perfect outing? 

Visitors will be able to submit their favorite things to do as well for others to enjoy. 

Some examples could:
 * Horse back riding
 * Community Park
 * Water Park
 * Bike Trail
 * Paragliding
 * BBQ at the beach
 * Vollyball
 * Ice Skating
 
Each of these items will have additional information such as costs, date and time availability, location, type of weather needed (ok on raining days?), how many people are needed, etc. This would help couples who would like to find some local date ideas or families that would like to have fun outside instead of staying at home on the weekends. 

There's plenty of stuff to do out here. We just need to have easier access to this information. We'll start first with the South East Florida area and expand from there.
