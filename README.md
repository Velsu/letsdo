# Let's Do
A web app that curates local activities to help you plan your outings. 
The concept is simple. We're always wondering what to do when there's tons of things we can do. Sure we can Google it but then we're wasting tons of times and searching through website after website trying to find something that will fit our needs. 

What if there was an app that had a database of a bunch of recommended activities to do and you could filter and sort through all those activities in order to find the perfect outing? 

Visitors will be able to submit their favorite things to do as well for others to enjoy. 

Some examples could:
 * Horse back riding
 * Community Park
 * Water Park
 * Bike Trail
 * Paragliding
 * BBQ at the beach
 * Vollyball
 * Ice Skating
 
Each of these items will have additional information such as costs, date and time availability, location, type of weather needed (ok on raining days?), how many people are needed, etc. This would help couples who would like to find some local date ideas or families that would like to have fun outside instead of staying at home on the weekends. 

What will make this app stand out is that it will be intuitive and smart enough to know the demographics of your group. You can customize the results by letting it know how many adults and/kids are planning on going and it will give you the calculated costs based on everyone's ages according the each place. So if you have 2 adults and 3 kids under the age of 10 and you'd like to go to Sea World, it will figure out how much each adult and kid ticket costs at Sea World and then give you the total cost. This way you'll have a better idea of how much a trip to Sea World will cost. 

It will also do something similar with time. It will calculate travel time and the estimated activity time and tell you about how much time you should allot for a particular activity. 

There's plenty of stuff to do out here. We just need to have easier access to this information. We'll start first with the South East Florida area and expand from there.
